# KeyboardLayoutLearning
An experiment with results to test the initial learnability of arbitrary keyboard layouts

This was an experiment conducted for my Human-Computer Interaction course at Goshen College in May of 2017. The experiment tests the speed of subjects in learning a keyboard layout which they are exposed to for the first time in a controlled environment. Some subjects are given layouts with more or less home row use, to see if there is any correlation between ease of learning and frequency of home row keystrokes. This repository gives the code and results for the project, with all identifying information removed.

There was no significant correlation found between speed of learning and frequency of home row use.
